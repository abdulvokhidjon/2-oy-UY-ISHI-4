    <h2>How to use this UI kit</h2>
    <p>This Figma Design makes heavy use of powerful Figma features, including components and Auto Layout.<br>
        If youâ€™re new to Figma, getting some basic knowledge about these features will greatly help you create landing pages with this kit.<br> We also recommend checking Figma's Help Center for the best tutorials on more advanced features, such as components, and Auto Layout.
        </p>
        <h2>From Figma to Shopify</h2>
        <p>This UI kit is designed to work with the Figma to Shopify with Instant Plugin. With this plugin you can send your Figma designs to Shopify in no-time. To get a better understanding how this works, please watch our Figma to Shopify Tutorial.
            Our recommended workflow is to get familiar with the structure of the sections used in the kit. Change the components to your own branding and content, then publish to Shopify via Instant. Any updates you make here inside Figma require a new copy + paste action.</p>
            <h2>Support</h2>
            <p>If you're having trouble with this kit, we're here to try and help via support@instant.so. We're a small team, but will get back to you as soon as possible.
